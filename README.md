# Crop Disease Detection using Deep Learning
# Overview
This project provides a web-based tool for farmers to upload crop images and detect diseases using deep learning (CNNs). By leveraging computer vision, farmers can quickly identify crop diseases and receive potential remedies, improving agricultural productivity.

# Features
 * Image Upload: Farmers can upload crop images through a user-friendly interface.
 *  Deep Learning Model: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifies crop diseases.
 *  Disease Identification: The model provides predictions with accuracy scores.
 *  Remedies & Suggestions: Displays possible treatments based on the detected disease.

# Technologies Used
     * Python (Core language)    
     * TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (Deep Leaning)
     * OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas (Image Processing)
     .
